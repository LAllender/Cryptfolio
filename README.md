# Ctyptfolio
As an investor in cryptocurrency I need to see the value of all my digital investments in one place so that I know what my portfolio is worth.

Given that I own, or intend to own, some digital currency:

I want to see a clear, easy to navigate landing page, that is visually intriguing, so that I am motivated to explore the app.

I want to find basic information about investing in cryptocurrency, that contains links to further information about investing in, or buying, cryptocurrency, so that I can initiate or build on my digital investments.

I want to add the type and quantity of my digital investments to the cryptfolio app, so that I can view the current value of all my cryptocurrency in one place.

I want to see a visual representation of my cryptocurrency portfolio, so that I can easily understand its composition and the value of its elements.

I want to play (have fun) with the value of my portfolio, so that I have a tangible feeling of its real world worth.

I want my cryptfolio to remain available when I refresh the page, so that I can easily view and adjust my portfolio as it changes.
