## <h2 style="text-align:center" id="purpose">Purpose</h2>

This is a multi page web app with multiple server side APIS.

We built this website as a way to practice our API requests and use skills, our teamwork skills. As well as our Git skills.

It was a way for me to design, code and deploy a single page application whilst reinforcing the basic skill set of any Full Stack programmer.

The site can be used as an example of basic javascript. Including functions, if statements, variables and more. 

As a result of this work I have learnt and refined the basics for website design using javascript.

## <h2 style="text-align:center" id="features">Features</h2>
This site has been created keeping accessability standards in mind.
It includes semantic html elements. These have been constructed in a logical structure.

Project
Given that I own, or intend to own, some digital currency:

As an investor in cryptocurrency I need to see the value of all my digital investments in one place so that I know what my portfolio is worth.

As a user I want to be able to see a clear and easy to navigate landing page so that I am motivated and able to easily navigate and explore the app.

As a user I want to easily find basic currency information so that I can initiate or build my digital portfolio.

As a user I want to be able to access links for further information so that I can be more informed.

As a user I want to be able to add amounts of a selected crypto to my display, so that I can view my total potential holdings and worth to make strategies.

As a user I want to see a visual representation (graphs) of my portfolio so that I can easily understand its composition and value of the elements.

As a user I want to be able to have some sort of rewards system so that I can have fun whilst using the app.

As a user I want to be able to visualize what my portfolio worth could purchase in the real world so that I can get a sense of the tangible nature of its worth.

As a user I want to be able to store my portfolio for use at a further time so that I don't have to keep re-entering my selections.

As a user I want to be able to update and adjust my portfolio to keep up with changes so that I am able to invest wisely and in a timely manner.
